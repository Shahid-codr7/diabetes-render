# Diabetes Prediction ML Model

A machine learning project for predicting the onset of diabetes using the PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset.

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building a predictive model to determine whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. The model uses the popular PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset and leverages Python and relevant machine learning libraries.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM etc.)
- Performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)
- Easy-to-use prediction script or web interface
- Reproducible code

## Dataset

The [PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, "Outcome", which indicates whether the patient has diabetes.

**Features:**
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (0 = No diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)
